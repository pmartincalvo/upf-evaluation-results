This repository contains the results of my student evaluations at UPF through the
Avaldo system. You can find an inventory below:

# Why upload this?

- I would like my prospective students to make up their minds with all the info
  they need.
- I would like my past students to know what are the results of the evaluations
  they were involved in.
- I think it's healthy for reviews to be public.
- I believe a public institution has an additional moral imperative to be
  transparent and be accountable, and I think publishing these results is
  aligned with this idea.
